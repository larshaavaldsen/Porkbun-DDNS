# Porkbun-DDNS
This is a simple DDNS script for Porkbun domains

It is not mission critical, but a quick easy way for keeping a subdomain dns records up to date on my non static IP at home.

To run this script on your own, simply change the secret and api keys, and also update the Porkbun api endpoint to reflect the domain, record type, and subdomain.
